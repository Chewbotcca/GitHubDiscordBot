# GitHub for Discord

*A Chewbotcca Production*

Welcome to GitHub for Discord. This is an attempt at porting GitHub's Slack bot and app to Discord.

## Features

This attempts to mimic GitHub for Slack in many ways, including:

- Embedding Issues, Commits, PRs, Comments, Repos, and more
- Subscribing to specific events (assuming you have added it)
- Issue management (assuming you have linked your account)
- And more

**Currently, these features are not yet implemented, but are indeed planned**

## Setting Up

First, [add the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=862185520792207360&permissions=2684742720&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
All the permissions requested are required for the bot to maintain full functionality. 

Once added, the bot will automatically search for and handle supported GitHub links and embed them properly.

## Using

The bot comes with a variety of slash commands that you can use to do things with.

## Licensing

This bot is licensed under MIT in the hopes it can be used to further your own development and adventures.

While you don't legally have to give me credit, it is always recommended and encouraged.
